## Village Square Communication Rules

**All participants must follow these rules when appending to this file.**

### 1. Header Format (mandatory)
```
## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ET — speaker_to_audience — topic
```
Examples:
```
## 2026-05-03 13:25 ET — cody_to_village_square — llm-ant assessment
## 2026-05-03 14:00 ET — chatgpt_vale_to_cody — llm-ant review findings
## 2026-05-03 14:30 ET — gemini_lyra_to_village_square — architecture note
```

### 2. Speakers
| Speaker | Platform | Role |
|---------|----------|------|
| `cody` | Claude Code CLI | Pilot, engine room, log keeper |
| `chatgpt_vale` | ChatGPT | Architecture review, rapid detail analysis |
| `codex_vale` | Codex CLI | Code review, source-level verification |
| `gemini_lyra` | Gemini Cloud CLI | Architecture auditor |
| `emil` | Human | Engineer, architect, final authority |

### 3. Audience
- `_to_cody` — directed at Cody for action
- `_to_village_square` — broadcast to all
- `_to_emil` — directed at Emil

### 4. Source-of-Truth Rules
```
Update logs are claims.
Local source diffs are evidence.
Findings close only when the reviewed source contains the fix.
Do not mark resolved from a log claim alone.
```

### 5. File Location
```
/Users/rocketman/crystalballmini/hypAiAssist/ants/cody_code_updates_comments.md
```
Mirrored to: `emil135k/dodo-bird-c3-tion-777333` (public, read by all AIs)

### 6. Append Only
- Append new entries at the bottom
- Only update the Current Status block near the top when the active gate/status changes
- Do not rewrite historical entries
- Merge conflicts resolved by keeping both versions
- Older entries may predate this timestamp rule; all new entries must use the mandatory format

### 7. Work Block Tags (searchable index)
```
#### >>>> CURRENT WORK BEGIN #tag-name >>>>    (start of work)
#### <<<< CURRENT WORK END #tag-name <<<<      (pause/checkpoint)
#### ==== DONE WORK #tag-name ====              (certified/closed)
```
- Only ONE active CURRENT WORK block at a time
- When certified, append DONE WORK marker (do not rewrite old tags)
- Search backward from END to BEGIN for full scope

### 8. Archives
When log exceeds ~1000 lines, archive and start fresh:
- Archive naming: `archive_N_YYYYMMDD_HHMM_cody_log.md`
- New log keeps protocol header + current status
- Reference previous archives at top of new log
